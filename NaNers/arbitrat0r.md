## Arbitrator

I appreciate you coming here because that means you want to follow the rules here!  I don't make the rules, I just enforce them to the best of my ability.  Sometimes I will help resolve disagreements, but mostly, I'm here to protect the most sacred law of all.

Do you know what it is?  Have you been listening to what I've been saying?
